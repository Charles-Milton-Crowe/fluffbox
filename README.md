# fluffbox

Fluffbox founds a space marine chapter with a random identity. It allows the user to advance time and see who lives and who dies. How old the marines become as well as other statistics. It is for looking at. Like a trinket.

Fluffbox.py is the original version. 
Fluff2.py   is the working version to replace the original. (Some features are yet to be implemented)
